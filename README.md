# Sentiment Analysis with Deep Learning

This project implements a sentiment analysis model using TensorFlow and Keras. It processes text data, trains a Bidirectional LSTM model to classify sentiments as positive or negative, and allows interactive sentiment prediction for any input text.

## Features

- Text preprocessing and tokenization
- Padding sequences for uniform input size
- Bidirectional LSTM-based deep learning model
- Interactive console-based sentiment prediction
